# About me
My name is Ido Vitman Zilber,
I'm a 10th grade high school student learning computer science.
I have started to experiment with code from a young age.
In my fifth garde I participated in an enrichment program for children,
there I was exposed to programming for the first time. Since than then I was hooked.
I'm intrested in many areas of the field but most of all I like web development.
This summer (2024) I had the oppotunity to work as an intern for RavenDB.
Because I had no expirience with RavenDB prior to the intership, I was 
tasked with being a "blank slate" forÂ neutrally comparing RavenDB to MongoDB.
I documented my experimence with both databases in a series of videos, which are availabe 
to watch on...
